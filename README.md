# personal website template
Some simple, but confusing code I wrote a while ago to showcase a website for myself.

It uses php to load data and build html based on the values supplied to it by an informational txt file.

Its in a template fasion, the steps below explain how to use it.

Steps:
1. Download project
2. Open txt/info and replace personal info with your own
3. Replace img/profile.jpg with profile photo
4. Replace img/logo.png and img/favicon.ico with logo photos
5. Replace txt/resume.pdf with pdf resume
6. In order to get google maps to work you need to open index.php and replace YOUR_API_KEY with your api key (https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/embed/get-api-key)
7. Install php on server (http://php.net/manual/en/install.php)
8. Deploy code and start servlet container
