Following user interaction the tool would capture the result of each cached request path, store it in an html representation, and bundle it with the necessary resources in a zip file in it's own thread. Increased the speed, performance, and robustness of testing suite by introducing embedded tomcat, overriding selenium/htmlunit drivers, adding 20% more tests, and refactoring entire suite. Created a series of bash script/cron jobs to monitor production servers. The scripts aggregated various linux, tomcat, java, and backup analytics in a json format. Setup multiple production linux servers running tomcat web applications from the ground up. ; Prelude Dynamics
